What is Netlink?:
A communication mechanism between kernel and user space, using sockets (like network sockets but for local use).
 It’s flexible and replaces older methods like ioctl.

Why Use It?:
Ideal for network-related tasks (e.g., querying interfaces), as it’s built into the Linux kernel and supports structured data 
exchange.

How Does It Work?:
User space creates a socket with socket(AF_NETLINK, SOCK_RAW, NETLINK_ROUTE).
Kernel and user space exchange messages, each with a header (nlmsghdr) and payload (data).

What’s a nlmsghdr?:
A structure defining a Netlink message: includes length, type, flags, sequence number, and process ID.
